# Java chess game
A fully functional chess game with complete piece logic (including en passant, castling, etc.). The program was written in Java 17 using the Swing library for graphical components. It was my first project, where I refined my OOP skills and clean code practices. 

# The features supported by the game include:
Animations
Full chessboard logic
Primitive artificial intelligence
Exporting the chessboard to a PNG file
Viewing a graph of move times
Game reset
Window adaptability
